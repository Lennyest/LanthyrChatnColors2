# LanthyrChatnColors2
An edited verrsion of my other plugin, using md5's source code to work with herochat.

This is a plugin created to work with herochat. Enter the markdown class in the Markdown package and you'll be able to add more channels
I'll add a config in the near future.

Adds the following:

Sign editing, /editsign <0-3> <text w/o colors>

"Chat security" prevents players from view your plugins if you need that for some reason.

and last but not least, basic markdown for Herochat without messing with colors.
